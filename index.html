	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>My name is Nick Paugys and I am currently a Freshman Computer Science major. I run cross country as well as track for the university but I also love to go
		camping, play spikeball, and overall just be outside with friends. I am the youngest of three kids in my immediate family and also have 2 older step siblings
		named Kyle and Mikayla.
	</p>
	<h3>What I Hope to Learn in This Course</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>How to build web applications</li>
		<li>How to better navigate my own computer</li>
		<li>How to build simple interactive gaming systems and things of the like </li>
		<li>If computer science is what really can capture my interest for the rest of my life</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h3>
	<p>One thing you'll find out about me right away is that I love running. I beleive it to be the most rewarding sport on Earth and the community that
		you can build through the sport is unreplicatable. Something about working towards running PRs and chasing trophies while suffering through races
		with your brothers is so fun and has the capability to build rock-solid friendships.
	</p>
	<h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
	<p>I'm actually a triplet! My triplet sister Victoria attends Lewis and my triplet brother attends Taylor University in Indiana.</p>
